Q2. Write a program in java to find the majority element of an array ?

	A majority element in an array of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and

	hence there is at most one such element).

	Expected Output:

	The given array is: 4  8  4  6  7  4  4  8

	There are no Majority Elements in the given array
	
import java util.*;
public class majorityelementofarray17
{
	public static void main(String x[])
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)
	}
}
