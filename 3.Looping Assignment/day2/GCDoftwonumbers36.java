/* Q36. Write a java program to find HCF (GCD) of two numbers.

You want a Java program to find the HCF (Highest Common Factor), also called GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers.

How it works?

HCF is the largest number that divides both numbers exactly.

We only need to check up to the smaller number (min) because a larger divisor than min can’t divide both.

If i divides both a and b (a % i == 0 && b % i == 0), then i is a common divisor.

The loop keeps updating hcf with the largest divisor found.

At the end, hcf is the answer.

✅ Example: a = 36, b = 60

Common divisors = {1, 2, 3, 6, 12}

Largest = 12 → HCF = 12.

            if (a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {
                hcf = i;   // update when common divisor found
