/*
Q23. Write a java program to Check Number Is Duck Number or Not.
Example : A Duck number is a positive number which has zeroes present in it, For example 3210, 8050896, 70709 are all Duck numbers.
Please note that a number with only leading 0s is not considered a Duck Number.
For example, numbers like 035 or 0012 are not considered as Duck Numbers.

		int temp = num;
